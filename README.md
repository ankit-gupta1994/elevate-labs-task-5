Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

The dataset used to perform EDA: Titanic dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

Performed EDA using Python on the Titanic dataset and extracted insights using visual and statistical exploration.
I have attached the .ipynb file containing the steps performed to do EDA and a PDF file of the same with key insights found from the dataset.
